SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.

SELECT OrderID, ProductName, Quantity FROM OrderDetails AS OD
INNER JOIN Products AS PR ON OD.ProductID = PR.ProductID;

Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,

SELECT(emp.FirstName || " " || emp.LastName) AS Employee_Name,ProductID, Quantity FROM Orders AS ord
INNER JOIN OrderDetails AS ord_det ON ord.OrderID = ord_det.OrderID
INNER JOIN Employees AS emp ON ord.EmployeeID = emp.EmployeeID;
